# Therapy-Verse

Partnered with Princeton's Sriram Hathwar to craft an AI mental health chatbot. Rooted in NLP and RNN techniques, this project draws from ELIZA's legacy. Powered by TensorFlow, it empathetically interacts, bridging AI and mental wellness. A user-friendly interface offers insightful conversations for holistic support.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow:** The project harnesses the power of TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework, for building and training neural network models.
- **Python:** The primary programming language used to develop the chatbot's codebase, enabling seamless integration of AI-driven functionality.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Advanced NLP techniques allow the chatbot to comprehend and interpret user input, fostering meaningful and context-aware conversations.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** By implementing RNNs, the chatbot achieves dynamic sequence generation, enabling the generation of coherent and contextually relevant responses.

## Features

- **Empathetic Conversations:** Utilizing sentiment analysis and contextual understanding, the chatbot offers empathetic and supportive conversations that resonate with users' emotional states.
- **Intent Recognition:** Employing advanced intent recognition models, the chatbot accurately identifies user needs and tailors responses to address individual queries and concerns.
- **Dynamic Response Generation:** Through sophisticated RNN mechanisms, the chatbot generates responses that evolve contextually, mimicking human-like conversational flow.
- **User-Friendly Interaction:** The chatbot's intuitive and interactive interface ensures seamless engagement, providing users with a comfortable and natural platform for seeking mental health support.
